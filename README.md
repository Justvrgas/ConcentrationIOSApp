# Concentration iOS App
The objective of this game is to find all of the mathcing pairs with the least amount of flips. Each card is face down and when flipped an emoji icon is displayed. Each car flip is also counted in display. The sole purpose of this app is to demonstrate the basic ideas of iOS app development. I show the structure of a model, controller, and a view. 

### Model
The model is what the application is (but not how it is displayed)
### Controller
The controller is how the model is presented to the user (UI logic)
### View
The view is the controller's minions
